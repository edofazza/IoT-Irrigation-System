# IoT Irrigation System
 
 The objective of this project is to adopt a smart irrigation system to water cultivated fields making use of  local water resources, e.g. aquifers and reservoirs, and using slow, constant and lossless techniques that allow for water saving and a better quality of irrigation. The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/edofazza/IoT-Irrigation-System/blob/main/documentation/irrigationsystem.pdf)

Data from the sensors are collected and then stored in a MySQL database. The user can then visualize them through a web interface developed using Grafana (you can find the json file for the dashboard in the "Grafana" directory).

**Technologies used**
* Contiki-OS
* Cooja
* Grafana
* MySQL
